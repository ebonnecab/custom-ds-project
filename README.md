# Exploratory Data Analysis on New York State Foster Care Dataset
The purpose of this project is to use exploratory data analysis methods to assess the number of indicated CPS reports in the New York State Foster Care System.

## Dataset
The dataset used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-state/nys-children-in-foster-care-annually ). The features of this dataset include the type of care, the number of admissions and discharges, the county, the year, how many children served, and CPS reports.

## What questions do I intend to answer with this data?

* What is the average number indicated CPS reports for NYS?
* What is the average number of reports by county?
* Which counties appear to have higher rates of CPS reports than others?
* What county has the highest rates of CPS reports and why?

## Technologies Used

* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Numpy

## Summary of Analysis

* The average number of indicated CPS reports is 780.
* The median number of indicated CPS reports is 263.
* NYC is the county with the highest number of indicated CPS reports.
* NYC had the lowest rate of CPS reports in 1995 and the highest rate in 2010.
* I am unable to conclude why the rate is so high from this dataset but it is worth exploring further.
